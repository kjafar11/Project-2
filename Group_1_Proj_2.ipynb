There can still only be one opponent, but there could possibly be zero tickets sold for the game, although that is very unlikely, and Beaver Stadium can hold about 100,000 people. It is also related to the Stadium diagram and the Location diagram. Both the location diagram and stadium diagram have a cardinality of (1,1) and the tickets diagram having a cardinality of (0,100000).

This diagram relates to the Merchandise diagram with a zero to many relationship.  There could be zero merchandise sales, although that would be unlikely, and we estimate there could be about 50,000 merchandise sales at a given game.  For the cardinality of the Merchandise diagram it is (0, 100000) because multiple pieces of merchandise can be bought in one merchandise sale, which is why it has a different cardinality than the cardinality for Merchandise Sales."
